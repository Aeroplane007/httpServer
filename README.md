# httpServer
A httpServer written in python that forms the basis of a basic Real-time Chat App

The backend is all written in python and uses a browser as a client. Data is stored in a MySQL database and passwords hashed on client side and then sent to server.

The real time updates comes from use of javascript fetch to continously ask the server for new messages.

Below you can see a video of the app when creating an account, adding frieds and chatting.
